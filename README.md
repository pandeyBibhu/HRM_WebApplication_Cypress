# My Cypress Project

This project is a sample Cypress testing setup that demonstrates how to write and run tests for a web application.

## How to Create This Project

Follow these steps to create a new Cypress project from scratch:

1. **Create a new folder for your project:**
   ```
   mkdir my-cypress-project
   cd my-cypress-project
   ```

2. **Initialize a new Node.js project:**
   ```
   npm init -y
   ```

3. **Install Cypress:**
   ```
   npm install cypress --save-dev
   ```

4. **Open Cypress for the first time (this will scaffold the folder structure):**
   ```
   npx cypress open
   ```

   This command will generate the `cypress` folder and default files.

## Project Structure

```
my-cypress-project
├── cypress
│   ├── integration
│   │   └── sample_spec.js       # Sample test specifications
│   ├── fixtures
│   │   └── example.json         # Sample data for tests
│   └── support
│       ├── commands.js          # Custom commands for tests
│       └── index.js             # Global configurations for Cypress
├── cypress.json                 # Cypress configuration file
├── package.json                 # npm configuration file
└── README.md                    # Project documentation
```

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-cypress-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run Cypress:**
   ```
   npx cypress open
   ```

   This command will open the Cypress Test Runner, where you can run your tests interactively.

## Writing Tests

You can write your tests in the `cypress/integration/sample_spec.js` file. This file contains sample test cases that demonstrate how to interact with your application and assert expected outcomes.

## Using Fixtures

The `cypress/fixtures/example.json` file contains sample data that can be used in your tests. You can use this data to mock API responses or provide input data for your tests.

## Custom Commands

If you need to create custom commands that can be reused across your tests, you can define them in the `cypress/support/commands.js` file.

## Configuration

The `cypress.json` file is used to configure various settings for Cypress, such as the base URL for your application and the integration folder.
